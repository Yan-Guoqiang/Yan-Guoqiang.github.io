  <p>
    I am a Ph.D. candidate in Public Management at <a href="https://www.seu.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Southeast University</a>, 
    supervised by Prof. Cheng Cheng. In my public administration doctoral program, I received both disciplinary training and sociological guidance from my supervisor. This interdisciplinary background has generated two main research threads:
  </p>

  <h6><strong>1. Public Policy Research Track:</strong></h6>
  <p>
    My public policy research began with <strong>Free Trade Zone Policy Evaluation</strong>, employing Staggered DID methods for traditional policy impact assessment (supervisor as first author, me as second author and corresponding). Through deep policy evaluation practice, I discovered the gap between policy effectiveness and public perception, prompting me to shift research focus from "whether policies are effective" to "why policies generate controversy".
  </p>
  <p>
    Based on this insight, I conducted <strong>Policy Narrative and Controversy Mechanism Research</strong>: "Why Do Good Policies Cause Controversy? The 'Narrative Gap' in Policy Process," utilizing web scraping and LLM text coding methods (thanks to technical support from <a href="https://www.yanwenwang.com/" target="_blank">Dr. Yanwen Wang</a>), analyzing controversy generation mechanisms from policy narrative perspective (second author and corresponding, Working Paper).
  </p>
  <p>
    Meanwhile, I returned to policy evaluation with expanded focus on complex <strong>Policy Synergy Research</strong>: elderly care policy coordination and inequality in elderly well-being, using dual-policy synergy DID methods to explore multi-policy interaction evaluation (second author, Under Review). This research led me to recognize traditional policy evaluation limitations, thus I committed to <strong>Policy Evaluation Method Innovation</strong>: new pathways for policy effectiveness evaluation through text similarity, attempting to construct new policy evaluation paradigms integrating text analysis with traditional econometric methods (Working Paper).
  </p>
  
  <h6><strong>2. Family and Population Research Track:</strong></h6>
  <p>
    My other research track centers on migrant populations, expanding from economic perspectives to sociological theoretical frameworks: starting with <strong>Migrant Population Economic Analysis</strong>, using traditional economic methods to explore migrant economic behavior and family decisions, producing two core published works: one in <em>Applied Economics</em> (ABS2/985 universities Category B journal, first author), another in the renowned family economics journal <em>Review of Economics of the Household</em> (ABS2, sole author).
  </p>
  <p>
    During in-depth research, I gradually found that pure economic analysis cannot fully explain the complexity of family transformation in Chinese contexts. Under my supervisor's guidance, I turned to sociological theory for deeper explanatory frameworks. Inspired by Yan Yunxiang's theory on individualization processes and new familialism in Chinese society, I conducted <strong>Individualization and New Familialism Empirical Research</strong>, re-examining family transformation through sociological theory, with 2 papers currently submitted to <em>China Perspective</em> and <em>Advances in Life Course Research</em> (both under review).
  </p>
  <p>
    Simultaneously, under my supervisor's guidance, I began exploring <strong>Quantitative Research from Relational Sociology Perspective</strong>, attempting to analyze health and risk coping in the individualization era using relational sociology theoretical frameworks (1 under review, 1 working paper).
