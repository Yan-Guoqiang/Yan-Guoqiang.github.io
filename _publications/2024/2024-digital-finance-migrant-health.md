  Digital inclusive finance plays a pivotal role in enhancing the welfare of the migrant population.This paper adopts data from the 2017-2018 China Migrants Dynamic Survey to analyse the effectof digital inclusive finance on migrants' health and the underlying mechanisms. The results showthat digital inclusive finance significantly improves migrants' health, which remains robust aftertaking full Consideration of endogeneity. The mechanism analysis suggests that digital inclusivefinance alleviates environmental pollution and enhances the accessibility of healthcare services，which in turn improves the health of migrants. Furthermore, the heterogeneity analysis reveals thatcompared with other migrants, digital inclusive finance has a greater health-enhancing effect onthe middle-aged and those without higher education or with public health education.
