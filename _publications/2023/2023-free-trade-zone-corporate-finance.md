  This paper investigates whether the establishment of free trade zones has alleviated corporate financial constraints in China. Using panel data of Chinese listed companies from 2010-2019, we employ a multi-period difference-in-differences method to explore the impact of free trade zone establishment on corporate financing constraints. The study finds that the establishment of free trade zones can alleviate corporate financing constraints, and the above conclusions remain valid after a series of robustness tests. Further heterogeneity analysis reveals that the establishment of free trade zones has a stronger effect on alleviating financing constraints for state-owned enterprises than for non-state-owned enterprises, and can significantly alleviate financing constraints for non-high-tech enterprises, but has no significant impact on high-tech enterprises' financing constraints. The mechanism analysis shows that free trade zone policies alleviate corporate financing constraints through paths of improving corporate innovation and foreign direct investment, while the improvement of financial development level plays a significant synergistic role in free trade zones alleviating corporate financing constraints. The research conclusions provide valuable policy basis for alleviating corporate financing constraints under the strategic background of high-level opening-up.

  使用2010—2019年中国上市公司的面板数据，采用多期双重差分法探讨了自贸区设立对企业融资约束的影响。研究发现，自贸区的设立能够缓解企业融资约束，上述结论经过一系列稳健性检验后依旧成立。进一步的异质性分析发现：自贸区设立对国有企业融资约束的缓解程度强于非国有企业，自贸区设立能显著缓解非高新技术企业融资约束，但对高新技术企业融资约束影响不显著。机制分析结果表明，自贸区政策通过提高企业创新和外商直接投资的路径缓解企业的融资约束，同时金融发展水平的提高在自贸区缓解企业融资约束中发挥了显著的协同作用。研究结论为高水平对外开放的战略背景下缓解企业融资约束提供了有价值的政策依据。
